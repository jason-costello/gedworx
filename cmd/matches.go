	Usage:
	  *  using defaults:  goworx matches -s gm
	  *  explicitly defining constraints: 	goworx matches -s gm -n 50 -o 0 -c 20 -l 45000 -t none

	// Here you will define your flags and configuration settings.

	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command
	// and all subcommands, e.g.:
	// matchesCmd.PersistentFlags().String("foo", "", "A help for foo")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	matchesCmd.Flags().StringP("source", "s", "gm", "source of matches.  Currently only gm (gedmatch) is a valid option and is default option.")
	matchesCmd.Flags().StringP("id", "i", "", "ID of person to find matches for.  This is a source specific id.")
	matchesCmd.Flags().IntP("num", "n", 50, "Number of matches returned.  Default is 50.")
	matchesCmd.Flags().IntP("offset", "o", 0, "Number of items to offset by.  Used in combination with number or returned for paging.  Default is 0")
	matchesCmd.Flags().IntP("cm", "c", 7, "Only return results with a shared cm value greater than this. Default is 7")
	matchesCmd.Flags().IntP("overlap-cutoff", "l", 45000, "Cutoff value for overlap.  Default is 45000.")
	matchesCmd.Flags().StringP("tag-groups", "t", "none", "Return tag-groups. Acceptable values are all, none, one  Default is none. ")
}
